I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/) at University of Melbourne, Australia. Prior to Ph.D., I spent over 3 years as an industrial machine learning engineer at Alibaba Group in Beijing, developing solutions for search user experience optimization. My major research interests are in dialogue systems, natural language processing, deep learning and neuro-symbolic reasoning.
